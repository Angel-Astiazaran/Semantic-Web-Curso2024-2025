    <h2>Resource Naming Strategy</h2>
    <p>The resource naming strategy is designed to ensure that each record in the dataset can be uniquely and clearly identified. 
       It combines key attributes of the dataset to form a structured and consistent naming convention.</p>
    <p>The proposed naming convention follows this structure:</p>
    <pre><code>residuo_{year}_{month}_{waste_type}_{district_name}</code></pre>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>year</strong>: The year of the record (e.g., 2024).</li>
        <li><strong>month</strong>: The month of the record (e.g., January).</li>
        <li><strong>waste_type</strong>: The type of waste (e.g., Commercial cardboard, Horse bedding).</li>
        <li><strong>district_name</strong>: The name of the district (e.g., Centro, Moncloa-Aravaca).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example for the first record in the dataset:</p>
    <pre><code>residuo_2024_january_horse_bedding_moncloa-aravaca</code></pre>
